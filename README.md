Hi 👋, I'm Chinedu Osmond Anyasor

This is about me;

Meet a versatile professional who transitioned from civil engineering👷‍♂️ to the world of technology. With  a solid foundation in engineering🏗️ principles, I 
now excel as a software tester & frontend developer. My analytical mindset, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills gained in civil engineering 
seamlessly translate into ensuring top-notch software quality. Embracing creativity and innovation, I build visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces 
while meticulously testing for robustness & reliability. A true asset in the realm of software testing & web development.

In software testing, Chinedu creates testing solutions by using manual testing🛠️ to uncover the highest-impact issues; and implementing automation tests💻 
that improve quality, impact, and return on investment💰; delivering high-quality software on time. I capture bugs🐞 and document 📂 every defeat for faster 
resolution, hereby ensuring quality, and speeding up delivery.
